# GROUP PROJECT (PATTERNS)


* A group project that works on each individuals skills of drawing patterns and shapes using python.
* This project also cements the concepts of TDD .

to be continued....



***Get shape from user***

def get_shape():
Get input from user to identify desired shape.

***Get height from user***
        
def get_height():
Requires user to input number to get height of the shape.


***Draw shape***
    
def draw_shape(size):
Use height and shape values to draw the desired shape.

***Draw prime triangle***
def is_prime(n):
Get shape using only prime numbers.

***Solve the Tower of Hanoi***
def tower_of_hanoi():
Test how the rings move from one pole to the next.
Check whether the poles are ordered from biggest pole tosmallest pole.


### To Run

* `python3 patterns.py`
* follow the input prompts to get the desired output

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_main.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_main.MyTestCase.test_step1`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
